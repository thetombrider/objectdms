## Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Development Priorities
1. Start with core user authentication
2. Implement basic document CRUD operations
3. Add search functionality
4. Implement file storage integration
5. Add advanced features (OCR, sharing, etc.)

### Frontend Development Priorities
1. Authentication views
2. Document management interface
3. Search and filtering
4. Advanced features and optimizations

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Focus on critical path testing
- Regular performance testing

### Security Considerations
- Regular security audits
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Secure file handling
- Regular dependency updates

## Success Metrics
- System response time < 200ms for common operations
- Search results returned in < 1s
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Successful handling of files up to 100MB
