## Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Development Priorities
1. ✓ Core user authentication
2. ✓ Basic document CRUD operations
3. ✓ Search functionality
4. ✓ File storage integration
5. Advanced features (OCR, sharing, etc.)

### Frontend Development Priorities
1. Authentication views
2. Document management interface
3. Search and filtering
4. Advanced features and optimizations

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Focus on critical path testing
- Regular performance testing

### Security Considerations
- Regular security audits
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Secure file handling
- Regular dependency updates

## Success Metrics
- System response time < 200ms for common operations
- Search results returned in < 1s
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Successful handling of files up to 100MB
